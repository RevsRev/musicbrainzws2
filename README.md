# Musicbrainz API Java Library

The Musicbrainz Java API library, [musicbrainz2-java](https://code.google.com/archive/p/musicbrainzws2-java/) has not been updated since 2014. Various forks have been made on github, but all of them are relatively old. This project is a fork of the original musicbrainz2 library, along with forks of other dependent libraries.

All subprojects have been updated:
- Maven is now used for the build process
- Dependency versions have been updated to their most recent releases
- Java version has been upgraded to 18

All of these changes required fairly substantial changes to the source code. As such, while the original authors and licenses have been preserved, any issues or feature requests should be submitted to the contributors of _this_ project rather than the original authors.
